# Protocol Buffers

This directory contains `.proto` files ([Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)) that define structured data types that may be used by the microservices in this repository and the clients that interact with them.
Each `.proto` file is individually versioned (i.e. MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
Developers should refer to this repository's Wiki to learn how these files are [versioned](https://github.com/legumeinfo/microservices/wiki/Tagging-Releases-and-Automated-Builds) and [organized](https://github.com/legumeinfo/microservices/wiki/Protocol-Buffers) before using them.
