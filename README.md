# GCV Microservices
This repository contains a microservices implementation of the [Genome Context Viewer](https://github.com/legumeinfo/lis_context_viewer) server.
Rather than interacting directly with a [Chado](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_-_Getting_Started) database, scripts are provided to load the relevant data from Chado into a Redis database to improve performance (see the [Wiki](https://github.com/legumeinfo/lis_gcv_microservices/wiki/Redis-Schema) for a description of the schema).

This readme will be updated as the code evolves.
